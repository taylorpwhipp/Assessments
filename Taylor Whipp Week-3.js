1. Write a simple React component that simply prints "I am a component" to the screen. Be sure to include all necessary imports, exports, etc...

2. Practice With Loops: In React, we often use the map function to iterate over an array held in state. To get more practice with this, write a vanilla javascript for loop that outputs the same thing as the map function below. 


var stuffArray = [42, "Arthur Dent", 1978, "Zaphod", "Vogon", "Marvin, the Paranoid Android"]

stuffArray.map(function(el, i){
	for 
  console.log(el + " is at index: " + i)
}

for (i=0,i<=stuffArray.length,i++){
	console.log (stuffArray.[i]+" is at index: "+ i)
}
// your for loop here, you can reference the same stuffArray variable


3. Basic sorting: Find the cheapest price -- you are given a list of prices and need to find the signle lowest price from the array. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers, and returns the lowest price
prices=[2,3,4.0]
var steal = function(){
	return Math.min (...prices)
}

  // your logic here
